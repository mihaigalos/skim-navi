# skim-navi example

This example shows how to use `skim-navi` in conjunction with a self-hosted http server using [`warpy`](https://github.com/mihaigalos/warpy).

`skim-navi` will list the contents of the `/tmp` folder.

To enter in a folder, simply start typing its name and use Up/Down to select it. Then press Tab to expand and enter it.

Select `..` to go one level up.

Enter, Esc or Ctrl+C  finishes the navigation.
